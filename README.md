# Numerical-Methods-Markov-Regression-Mnist-Probabilistic-and-Machine-Learning-Methods

This project explores key concepts from **Markov chains**, **linear regression**, and **dataset processing (MNIST)**.  
Itâ€™s divided into three main modules:

- ðŸ”¹ **Markov-is-coming** â€“ working with labyrinths and transition matrices using iterative methods.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Linear-regression** â€“ implementing linear, ridge, and lasso regression algorithms.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Mnist-101** â€“ loading and splitting datasets for training and testing.
